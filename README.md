**NoteHub**

The “**NoteHub**” is an app where you add notes for your daily life. This is developed using Flutter. 
NoteHub is a clean and functional notes app. Here we can add our notes and whenever we want, we can update and delete our notes.

**Tech stack used:**
  1. Using “**Flutter**” for a clean UI and UX
  2. Here “**sqflite**” is used so that the user’s data is saved locally. It is very important to use a database so that the user can access their notes whenever they want.
  3. Here “**Provider**” also used for manage the data globally. This becomes very useful when notes are added to another page and those notes are reflected on the Dashboard page
     
**Here some pictures:**
